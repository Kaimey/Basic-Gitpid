# First Project for Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development

## Project Chosen - Gym
Project Example Idea 2
Build a website for a gym

External userâ€™s goal:
The site's users are gym members and potential members, who want to know more about the gym and its procedures.

Site owner's goal:
The gym is interested in attracting and retaining members.

Potential features to include:
Showcase photos of people having fun exercising in the gym and any other media to motivate people to come.
 Provide detail on the organised classes in the gym and their schedule.

Provide information on the gym's location, opening hours, contact details and any external resources.

### Project goal is to create a fully functional website with images, buttons, text and interactive navbar that is both appealing and well constructed.

I have chosen to create a website for a hypothetical gym using images from my local area to assist.

This project is the culminated skills learned via the code institute tutorial and training videos along with self found research into additional methods on how to build a website in CSS and HTML using bootstrap to assist.

### Starting point
My initial plan is for a simple design and to test my skills as i progress through the project.

Initially i started out with a basic layout using bootstraps Navbar features found on [a link to bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/)

From there i would use an image from AI to use as a background for my project.

Using the bootstraps features for containters i would aim to fit my main body of text in a section of 6 which would fill half the screen and make it easier to fill and control when attempting to run on other devices.

Sticking to the main goal of creating a functioning website with an appeal i tried a variation of images and navbar elements before settling for what is on show now.

Using information found on (https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/gradient-navbar/) i was able to add a gradient to my navbar which is something i haven't attempted before.

Using previous projects i had worked on such as Love Running in which i created a basic website using replit. I was able to create a simple footer using the Font Awesome tools that enable small images such as the Instagram image found [instagram fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/instagram?f=brands&s=solid). 

#### Progress

*Created navbar additional links and linked them to about.html, Gallery.html & signup.html.
*Created the signup page using a simple bootstrap signup code link 
*Added the main section containers using col col-md-6 to keep the layout pleasant and accessible to other devices.
*added images and created a border whilst using a curved border technique with bootstrap
*Created a gallery using techniques learnt from creating a gallery on the Love Runnig project - Making sure it is mobile usable and isn't effected by the opacity already added to the main page images.
*Created CSS styles for the text that is best viewable with the image in the background - Changed colours multiple times.
*Made the background and navbar/border colours as pleasant and in keep with the Beach aestetic.
*Created a pricing list using Classes and List functions to keep it simple but appealing to the eye, whilst maintaining it's functionality in other device formats.
*Tested all pages in other device formats and we're working correctly.
*Labeled all sections that we're completed on both CSS and html.

####Issues
*I decided to make the navbar also accessible for mobile device by enabling the function. This took a large sum of time and trial and error as it was not working after several attempts.
Eventually after much investigation it appears you need to enable 
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> to be able to activate this option in the bootstrap element. This code was put at the bottom of the index.html after the final </body> option.
*original project attempt was dropped after failing to link Bootstrap correctly and once linkned mid project caused substancial errors.
* Original events section was based on a previous project layout and failed to look correct in this setting, Took substancial time to create a basic layout that worked correctly.
* Tested in WC3 Markup validation and multiple errors missed.
* Deleted said errors which were not causing issues with the code but we're unnecesary and irrelevant such as align:center; on the btn function. 

####Performance
*tested performance and multiple errors showing <div> not closed and errors with bootstrap attachment.
*Fixed errors showing <div> issues and no longer showing as failed.
*Bootstrap working correctly
*issues with div spacing on the main sections - Works correctly on all devices except full screen PC
